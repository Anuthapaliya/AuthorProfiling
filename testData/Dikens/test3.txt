" Pray," said Mr. Lorry, in a soothing tone, bringing 
his left hand from the back of the chair to lay it on the 
supplicatory fingers that clasped him in bo violent a 
tremble : " pray control your agitation — a matter of 
business. As I was saying" 

Her look so discomposed him that he stopped, wan- 
dered, and began anew : 

"As I was saying; if Monsieur Manctte had not 
died ; if he had suddenly and silently disappeared ; if he 
had been spirited away ; if it had not been difficult to 
guess to what dreadful place, though no art could trace 
him ; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could 
exercise a privilege that I in my own time have known 
the boldest people afraid to speak of in a whisper, across 
the water, there * for instance, the privilege of filling up 
blank forms for the consignment of any one to the obliv- 
ion of a prison for any length of time ; if his wife had 
implored the king, the queen, the court, the clergy, for 
any tidings of him, and all quite in vain; — then the 
history of your father would have been the history of 
this unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais." 

" I entreat you to tell me more, sir." 

" I will. I am going to. You can bear it ? " 

" I can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave 
me in at this moment." 

"You speak collectedly, and you — are collected. 
That's good 1" (Though his manner was less satisfied 
than his words.) "A matter of business. Regard it 
as a matter of business — business that must be done. 
Now, if this Doctor's wife, though a lady of great 
courage and spirit, had suffered so intensely from this 
cause before her little child was born" ■ 

" The little child was a daughter, sir."

"A daughter. A — a— .matter of business — don't 
be distressed. Miss, if the poor lady had suffered bo 
intensely before her little child was born, that she came 
to the determination of sparing the poor child the in- 
heritance of any part of the agony she had known the 
pains of, by rearing her in the belief that her father was 

dead No, don't kneel I In Heaven's name why 

should you kneel to me 1 " 

" For the truth. O dear, good, compassionate sir, for 
the truth!" 

"A — a matter of business. Tou confuse me, and 
how can I transact business if I am confused ? Let 119 
be clear-headed. If you could kindly mention now, for 
instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many 
shillings in twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging. 
I should be so much more at my ease about your state 
of mind." 

Without directly answering to this appeal, she sat so 
still when he had very gently raised her, and the bands 
that had not ceased to clasp his wrists were bo much 
more steady than they had been, that she communicated 
some reassurance to Mr. Jarvia Lorry. 

11 That's right, that's right. Courage ! Business ! 
Tou have business before you ; useful business. Miss 
Manette, your mother took this course with you. And 
when she died — I believe broken-hearted — having 
never slackened her unavailing search for your father, 
she left you, at two years old, to grow to be blooming, 
beautiful, and happy, without the dark cloud upon yon 
of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore 
his heart out in prison, or wasted there through many 
lingering years." 

As he said the words, he looked down, with an admir-

ing pity, on the flowing golden hair ; as if he pictured 
to himself that it might have been already tinged with 

" You know that jour parents had no great possession, 
and that what they had was secured to your mother and 
to you. There has been no new discovery, of money, 
or of any other property ; but " 

He felt his wrist held closer, and he stopped. The 
expression in the forehead, which had bo particularly 
attracted his notice, and which was now immovable, had 
deepened into one of pain and horror. 

" But he has been — been found. He is alive. 
Greatly changed, it is too probable; almost a wreck, 
it is possible ; though we will hope the best. Still, 
alive. Tour rather has been taken to the house of an 
old servant in Paris, and we are going there: I, to 
identify him, if I can : you, to restore him to life, love, 
doty, rest, comfort." 

A shiver ran through her frame, and from it through 
his. She said, in a low, distinct, awe-stricken voice, as if 
she were saying it in a dream, — 

"lam going to see his Ghost I It will be his Ghost 
—not him I" 

Mr. Lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm. 
"There, there, there! See now, see now I The best 
and the worst are known to you now. You are well on 
your way to the poor wronged gentleman, and, with a 
fair sea-voyage, and a fair land journey, you will be soon 
at his dear side." 

She repeated in the same tone, sunk to a whisper, 
" I have been free, I have been happy, yet his Ghost has 
never haunted me 1 " 

" Only one thing more," said Mr. Lorry, laying stress

upon it aa a wholesome means of enforcing her atten- 
tion : " he has been found under another name ; his 
own, long forgotten or long concealed. It would be 
worse than useless now to inquire which ; worse than 
useless to seek to know whether he has been for years 
overlooked, or always designedly held prisoner. It 
would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries, 
because it would be dangerous. Better not to mention 
the subject, anywhere or in any way, and to remove bim 
— for a while at all events — out of France. Even I, 
safe as an Englishman, and even Tellson's, important as 
they are to French credit, avoid all naming of the mat- 
ter, I carry about me, not a scrap of writing openly 
referring to it. This is a secret service altogether. My 
credentials, entries, and memoranda, are all comprehend- 
ed in the one line, ' Recalled to Life ; ' which may mean 
anything. But what is the matter ! She doesn't notice 
a word ! Miss Manette ! " 

Perfectly stilt and silent, and not even fallen back in 
her chair, she sat under his hand, utterly insensible, with 
her eyes open and fixed upon him, and with that last 
expression looking as if it were carved or branded into 
her forehead. So close was her hold upon his arm, that 
he feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her; 
therefore he called out loudly for assistance without 
moving. 

A wild-looking woman, whom, even in his agitation, 
Mr. Lorry observed to be all of a red color, and to have 
red hair, and to he dressed in some extraordinary tight- 
fitting fashion, and to have on her head a most wonder- 
ful bonnet like a Grenadier wooden measure, and good 
measure too, or a great Stilton cheese, came running 
into the room in advance of the inn-servants, and soon

settled the question of his detachment from the poor 
young lady, by laying a brawny hand upon bis chest, and 
sending him flying back against the nearest wall. 

(" I really think this must be a man ! " was Mr, 
Lorry's breathless reflection, simultaneously with his 
coming against the wall.) 

" Why, look at you all ! " bawled this figure, address- 
ing the inn-servants. "Why don't you go and fetch 
things, instead of standing there staring at me ? I am 
not so much to look at, am I ? Why don't you go and 
fetch things ? I'll let you know, if you don't bring smell- 
ing-salts, cold water, and vinegar, quick, I will ! " 

There was an immediate dispersal for these restora- 
tives, and she softly laid the patient on a sofa, and tend- 
ed her with great skill and gentleness : calling ber " my 
precious!" and "my bird!" and spreading her golden 
hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care. 

" And you in brown ! " she said, indignantly turning 
on Mr. lorry ; " couldn't you tell her what you had to 
tell ber, without frightening ber to death ? Look at her, 
with her pretty pale face and her cold hands. Do you 
call thai being a Banker?" 

Mr. Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a ques- 
tion so hard to answer, that he could only look on, at 
a distance, with much feebler sympathy and humility, 
while the strong woman, having banished the inn-ser- 
vants under the mysterious penalty of "letting them 
know " something not mentioned if they stayed there, 
staring, recovered her charge by a regular series of gra- 
dations, and coaxed her to lay her drooping head upon her 
shoulder. 

" I hope she will do well now," said Mr. Lorry. 

" No thanks to you in brown, if she does. My dar- 
ling pretty 1 "

" I hope," said Mr. Lorry, after another pause of 
feeble sympathy and humility, " that you accompany 
Miss Manette to France?" 

" A likely thing, too 1 " replied the strong woman. " If 
it was ever intended that I should go across salt water, 
do you suppose Providence would have cast my lot in an 
island?" 

This being another question hard to answer, Mr. Jar- 
vis Lorry withdrew to consider it
