A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human 
creature is constituted to be that profound secret and 
mastery to every other. A solemn consideration, when 
I enter a great city by night, that every one of those 
darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret ; that 
every room in every one of them encloses its own secret ; 
that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of 
breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret to 
the heart nearest it I Something of the awnilness, even 
of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can I turn 
the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope 
in time to read it all. No more can I look into the 
depths of this unfathomable water, wherein, as momen- 
tary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses of buried 
treasure and other things submerged. It was appointed 
that the book should shut with a spring, forever and for- 
ever, when I had read but a page. It was appointed 
that the water should be locked iu an eternal frost, when 
the light was playing on its surface, and I stood in igno- 
rance on the shore. My friend is dead, niy neighbor is 
dead, my love, the darling of my soul, is dead j it is the 
inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret 
that was always in that individuality, and which I shall 
carry in mine to my life's end. In any of the burial-

places of this city through which I pass, ia there a sleeper 
more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their 
innermost personality, to me, or than I am to them ? 

As to this, his natural and not to be alienated inheri- 
tance, the messenger on horseback had exactly the same 
possessions as the King, the first Minister of Slate, or the 
richest merchant in London. So with the three passen- 
gers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering 
old mail-coach ; they were mysteries to one another, as 
complete as if each had been in his own coach and six, 
or his own coach and sixty, with the breadth of a county 
between him and the next. 

The messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping 
pretty often at ale-houses by the way to drink, but evin- 
cing a tendency to keep his own counsel, and to keep his 
hat cocked over his eyes. He had eyes that assorted 
very well with that decoration, being of a surface black, 
with no depth in the color or form, and much too near 
together — as if they were afraid of being found out in 
something, singly, if they kept too far apart. They had 
a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat like a 
three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the 
chin and throat, which descended nearly to the wearer's 
knees. When he stopped for drink, be moved this 
muffler with his left baud, only while he poured his 
liquor in with his right ; as soon as that was done, he 
muffled again. 

" No, Jerry, no I " said the messenger, harping on one 
theme as he rode, "It wouldn't do for. you, Jerry. 
Jerry, you honest tradesman, it wouldn't suit yowr line 

of business! Recalled -1 Bust me if I don't think 

he'd been a-drinking 1 " 

His message perplexed his mind to that degree that

be wns fain, several times, to take off bis bat to scratch 
his bead. Except on the crown, which was raggedly 
bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all over 
it, and growing down-hill almost to his broad, blnnt nose. 
It was so like smith's work, so much more like the top 
of a strongly spiked wall than a head of hair, that the 
best of players at leap-frog might have declined biro, as 
the most dangerous man in the world to go over. 

While he trotted back with the message be was to 
deliver to the night watchman in his box at the door of 
Tellson'a Bank, by Temple-bar, who was to deliver it to 
greater authorities within, the shadows of the night took 
such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took 
such shapes to the mare as arose out of her private 
topics of uneasiness. They seemed to be numerous, for 
she shied at every shadow on the road. 

What time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, 
and bumped upon its tedious way, with its three fellow- 
inscnitables inside. To whom, likewise, the shadows of 
the night revealed themselves, in the forms their dosing 
eyes and wandering thoughts suggested. 

Tellson'a Bank had a run upon it in the mail. As 
the bank passenger — with an arm drawn through the 
leathern strap, which did what lay in it to keep him from 
pounding against the next passenger, and driving him 
into his comer, whenever the coach got a special jolt — 
nodded in his place with half-shut eyes, the little coach- 
windows, and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through 
them, and the bulky bundle of opposite passenger, be- 
came the bank, and did a great stroke of business. The 
rattle of the harness was the chink of money, and more 
drafts were honored in five minutes than even Tellson'a, 
with all its foreign and home connection, ever paid in
