It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it 
was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it 
was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, 
it was the season of Light, it was the season of Dark- 
ness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of de- 
spair, we had everything before us, we had nothing be- 
fore us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all 
going direct the other way, — in short, the period was so 
fer like the present period, that some of its noisiest an- 
thorities insisted on its being received, for good or for 
evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only. 

There were a king with a large jaw and a qneen with 
a plain face, on the throne, of England ; there were a king 
with a large jaw and a qneen with a fair face on the 
throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than 
crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and 
nshes, that things in general were settled forever.

It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven 
hundred and seventy-live. Spiritual revelations were 
conceded to England at that favored period, as at this. 
Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five and-t wen tieth 
blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the 
Life Guards bad heralded the sublime appearance by 
announcing that arrangements were made for the swal- 
lowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock- 
lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, 
after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very 
year last past (supernatu rally deficient in originality) 
rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the earthly order 
of events had lately come to the English Grown and 
People, from a congress of British subjects in America: 
which, strange to relate, have proved more important to 
the human race than any communications yet received 
through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood. 

France, less favored on the whole-as to matters spirit- 
ual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with 
exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money 
and spending it. Under the guidance of her Christian 
pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such hu- 
mane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his 
hands cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and his 
body burned alive, because he had not kneeled down in 
the rain to do honor to a dirly procession of monks which 
passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or 
sixty yards. It is likely enough that^ rooted in the 
woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees, 
when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by 
the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into 
boards, to make a certain movable framework with a 
sack and a knife in it, terrible in history. It is likely

enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the 
heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered from 
the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with 
rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by 
poultry, which the Farmer, Death, had already set apart 
to be his tumbrils of the Revolution. But, that Wood- 
man and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, 
work silently, and no one heard tbem as they went about 
with muffled tread ; the rather, forasmuch as to entertain 
any suspicion that they were awake, was to be atheistical 
and traitorous. 

In England, there was scarcely an amount of order 
and protection to justify much national boasting. Daring 
burglaries by armed men, and highway robberies, took 
place in the capital itself every night; families were 
publicly cautioned not to go out of town without remov- 
ing their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for secu- 
rity ; the highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman 
in the light, and, being recognized and challenged by his 
fellow-tradesman whom he slopped in his character of 
"the Captain," gallantly shot him through the head and 
rode away ; the mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and 
the guard shot three dead, and then got shot dead himself 
by the other four, "in consequence of the failure of his 
ammunition ; " after which the mail was robbed in peace ; 
that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, 
was made to stand and deliver on Tumham Green, by 
one highwayman, who despoiled the illustrious creature 
in sight of all his retinue ; prisoners in London jails 
fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of 
the law fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with 
rounds of shot and ball ; thieves snipped off diamond 
crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court drawing-

rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles's, to search for 
contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, 
and the musketeers fired on the mob; and nobody 
thought any of these occurrences much out of the com- 
mon way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever 
busy and ever worse than useless, was in constant requi- 
sition ; now, stringing up long rows of miscellaneous 
criminals; now, hanging a house-breaker on Saturday 
who had been taken on Tuesday ; now, burning people 
in the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning 
pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall ; to-day, tak- 
ing the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of 
a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's boy of 
sixpence. 

All these things, and a thousand like them, came to 
pass in and close upon the dear old year one thousand 
seven hundred and seventy-five. Environed by them, 
while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded, 
those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the 
plain and the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and car- 
ried their divine rights with a high hand. Thus did the 
year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five con- 
duct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures 
— the creatures of this chronicle among the rest — along 
the roads that lay before them.

CHAPTER II. 

THE MALL. 



It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night 
lata in November, before the first of the persons with 
whom this history has business. The Dover road lav, 
as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up 
Shooter's Hill. He walked up-hill in the mire by the 
side of the mail, as the rest of the passengers did ; not 
because they had the least relish for walking exercise, 
under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the 
harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, 
that the horses had three times already come to a stop, 
besides once drawing the coach across the road, with the 
mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheatb. Reins 
and whip and coachman and guard, however, in combina- 
tion, had read that article of war wbicb forbade a purpose 
otherwise strongly in favor of the argument, that some 
brute animals are endued with Reason ; and the team 
had capitulated and returned to their duty. 

With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed 
their way through the thick mud, floundering and stum- 
bling between whiles as if they were falling to pieces at 
the larger joints. As often as the driver rested them 
and brought them to a stand, with a wary " Wo-ho ! so- 
ho then I " the near leader violently shook his head and 
everything upon it, — like an unusually emphatic horse,

denying that the coach could be got up the hill. When- 
ever the leader made this rattle, the pasaenger started, 
aa a nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in 

There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it 
had roamed in its forlornnesa up the hill, like an evil 
spirit, seeking rest and rinding none. A clammy and in- 
tensely cold mist, it made ita alow way through the air 
in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one an- 
other, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It 
was dense enough to shut oat everything from the light 
of the coach-lamps but these its own workings, and a few 
yards of road ; and the reek of the laboring horses 
steamed into it, as if they had made It all. 

Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding 
up the hill by the side of the mail. All three were 
wrapped to the cheek-bones and over the ears, and wore 
jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from 
anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; 
and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers 
from the eyes of the mind, as from the eyes of the body, 
of his two companions. In those days, travellers were 
very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for any- 
body on the road might be a robber or in league with 
robbers. As to the latter, when every posting-house and 
ale-house could produce somebody in " the Captain's " 
pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable non- 
descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So 
the guard of the Dover mail thought to himself, that 
Friday night in November one thousand seven hundred 
and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter's Hill, as he 
stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beat- 
ing his feet, and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-

eliest before him, where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the 
top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols, deposited on a 
substratum of cutlass. 

The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that 
the guard suspected the
