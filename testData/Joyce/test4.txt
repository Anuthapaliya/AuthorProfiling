Was that a sin for Father Arnall to be in a wax or 
was he allowed to get into a wax when the boys were 
idle because that made them study better or was he only 
letting on to be in a wax? It was because he was al- 
lowed because a priest would know what a sin was and 
would not do it. But if he did it one time by mistake 
what would he do to go to confession? Perhaps he 
would go to confession to the minister. And if the min- 
ister did it he would go to the rector : and the rector to 
the provincial : and the provincial to the general of the 
Jesuits. That was called the order : and he had heard his 
father say that they were all clever men. They could 
all have become high-up people in the world if they had 
not become Jesuits. And he wondered what Father 
Arnall and Paddy Barrett would have become and what 
Mr McGlade and Mr Gleeson would have become if they 
had not become Jesuits. It was hard to think what be- 
cause you would have to think of them in a different 
way with different coloured coats and trousers and with 
beards and moustaches and different kinds of hats. 

The door opened quietly and closed. A quick whisper 
ran through the class : the prefect of studies. There was 
an instant of dead silence and then the loud crack of a 
pandybat on the last desk. Stephen *s heart leapt up 
in fear. 
— Any boys want flogging here. Father Arnall ? cried 
the prefect of studies. Any lazy idle loafers that want 
flogging in this class? 

He came to the middle of the class and saw Fleming 
on his knees. 

[51) 



— Hoho! he cried. Who is this boy? Why is he on 
his knees ? What is your name, boy ? 

— Fleming, sir. 

— Hoho, Fleming! An idler of course. I can see 
it in your eye. Why is he on his knees, Father Ar- 
nall? 

. — He wrote a bad Latin theme. Father Arnall said, 
and he missed all the questions in grammar. 

— Of course he did! cried the prefect of studies, of 
course he did ! A bom idler ! I can see it in the corner 
of his eye. 

He banged his pandybat down on the desk and cried : 

— Up, Fleming ! Up, my boy ! 
Fleming stood up slowly. 

— Hold out ! cried the prefect of studies. 

Fleming held out his hand. The pandybat came down 
on it with a loud smacking sound : one, two, three, four, 
^YBy six. 

— Other hand ! 

The pandybat came down again in six loud quick 
smacks. 

— Kneel down! cried the prefect of studies. 
Fleming knelt down squeezing his hands under his 

armpits, his face contorted with pain, but Stephen knew 
how hard his hands were because Fleming was always 
rubbing rosin into them. But perhaps he -was in great 
pain for the noise of the pandybat was terrible. 
Stephen's heart was beating and fluttering. 

— At your work, all of you! shouted the prefect of 
studies. We want no lazy idle loafers here, lazy idle 
little schemers. At your work, I tell you. Father 
Dolan will be in to see you every day. Father Dolan 
will be in tomorrow. 

[52] 



He poked one of the boys in the side with the pandy- 
bat, saying : 

— You, boy ! When will Father Dolan be in again ? 

— Tomorrow, sir, said Tom Furlong's voice. 

— Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, said the 
prefect of studies. Make up your minds for that. 
Every day Father Dolan. Write away. You, boy, who 
are you 1 

Stephen's heart jumped suddenly. 

— Dedalus, sir. 

— Why are you not writing like the others? 
— I . . . my . . . 

He could not speak with fright. 

— Why is he not writing. Father Arnall ? 

— He broke his glasses, said Father Arnall, and I 
exempted him from work. 

— Broke? What is this I hear? What is this? 
Your name is? said the prefect of studies. 

— Dedalus, sir. 

— Out here, Dedalus. Lazy little schemer. I see 
schemer in your face. Where did you break your 
glasses ? 

Stephen stumbled into the middle of the class, blinded 
by fear and haste. 

— Where did you break your glasses? repeated the 
prefect of studies. 

— The cinderpath, sir. 

— Iloho! The cinderpath! cried the prefect of 
studies. I know that trick. 

Stephen lifted his eyes in wonder and saw for a mo- 
ment Father Dolan 's whitegrey not young face, his 
baldy whitegrey head with fluff at the sides of it, the 
steel rims of his spectacles and his no-coloured eyes look- 

[53] 



ing through the glasses. Why did he say he knew that 
trick? 

— Lazy idle little loafer ! cried the prefect of studies. 
Broke my glasses! An old schoolboy trick! Out with 
your hand this moment ! 

Stephen closed his eyes and held out in the air his 
trembling hand with the palm upwards. He felt the 
prefect of studies touch it for a moment at the fingers 
to straighten it and then the swish of the sleeve of the 
soutane as the pandybat was lifted to strike. A hot 
burning stinging tingling blow like the loud crack of a 
broken stick made his trembling hand crumple together 
like a leaf in the fire: and at the sound and the pain 
scalding tears were driven into his eyes. His whole 
body was shaking with fright, his arm was shaking and 
his crumpled burning livid hand shook like a loose leaf 
in the air. A cry sprang to his lips, a prayer to be let 
off. But though the tears scalded his eyes and his limbs 
quivered with pain and fright he held back the hot tears 
and the cry that scalded his throat.
