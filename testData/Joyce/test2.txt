Stephen looked at the plump turkey which had lain, 
trussed and skewered, on the kitchen table. He knew 
that his father had paid a guinea for it in Dunn's of 
D 'Olier Street and that the man had prodded it often at 
the breastbone to show how good it was: and he remem- 
bered the man 's voice when he had said : 

— Take that one, sir. That's the real Ally Daly. 
Why did Mr Barrett in Clongowes call his pandy- 

bat a turkey? But Clongowes was far away: and the 
warm heavy smell of turkey and ham and celery rose 
from the plates and dishes and the great fire was banked 
high and red in the grate and the green ivy and red 
holly made you feel so happy and when dinner was ended 
the big plum pudding would be carried in, studded with 
peeled almonds and sprigs of holly, with bluish fire 
running around it and a little green flag flying from the 
top. 

It was his first Christmas dinner and he thought of 
his little brothers and sisters who were waiting in the 
nursery, as he had often waited, till the pudding came. 
The deep low collar and the Eton jacket made him feel 
queer and oldish : and that morning when his mother had 
brought him down to the parlour, dressed for mass, his 
father had cried. That was because he was thinking 
of his own father. And Uncle Charles had said so 
too. 

Mr Dedalus covered the dish and began to eat hun- 
grily. Then he said : 

— Poor old Christy, he's nearly lopsided now with 
roguery. 

[29] 



— Simon, said Mrs Dedalus, you haven't given Mrs 
Eiordan any sauce. 

Mr Dedalus seized the sauceboat. 

— Haven't I? he cried. Mrs Kiordan, pity the poor 
blind. 

Dante covered her plate with her hands and said : 

— No, thanks. 

Mr Dedalus turned to Uncle Charles. 

— How are you off, sir ? 

— Eight as the mail, Simon. 
—-You, 'John? 

— I'm all right. Go on yourself. 

— Mary? Here, Stephen, here's something to make 
your hair curl. 

He poured sauce freely over Stephen's plate and set 
the boat again on the table. Then he asked Uncle 
Charles was it tender. Uncle Charles could not speak 
because his mouth was full but he nodded that it was. 

— That was a good answer our friend made to the 
canon. What? said Mr Dedalus. 

— I didn't think he had that much in him, said Mr 
Casey. 

— I^ll pay your dues, father, when you cease turning 
the house of God into a polling-'booth. 

— A nice answer, said Dante, for any man calling 
himself a catholic to give to his priest. 

— They have only themselves to blame, said Mr 
Dedalus suavely. If they took a fool's advice they 
would confine their attention to religion. 

— It is religion, Dante said. They are doing their 
duty in warning the people. 

— We go to the house of God, Mr Casey said, in all 

[30] 



humility to pray to our Maker and not to hear election 
addresses. 

— It is religion, Dante said again. They are right. 
They must direct their flocks. 

— And preach politics from the altar, is it ? asked ^Ir 
Dedalus. 

— Certainly, said Dante. It is a question of public 
morality. A priest would not be a priest if he did not 
tell his flock what is right and what is wrong. 

Mrs Dedalus laid down her knife and fork, saying : 

— For pity sake and for pity sake let us have no po- 
litical discussion on this day of all days in the year. 

— Quite right, ma'am, said Uncle Charles. Now 
Simon, that's quite enough now. Not another word now. 

— Yes, yes, said Mr Dedalus quickly. 
He uncovered the dish boldly and said : 

— Now then, who 's for more turkey ? 
Nobody answered. Dante said : 

— Nice language for any catholic to use ! 

— Mrs Riordan, I appeal to you, said Mrs Dedalus, 
to let the matter drop now. 

Dante turned on her and said : 

— And am I to sit here and listen to the pastors of my 
church being flouted? 

— Nobody is saying a word against them, said Mr 
Dedalus, so long as they don't meddle in politics. 

— The bishops and priests of Ireland have spoken, said 
Dante, and they must be obeyed. 

— Let them leave politics alone, said Mr Casey ; or the 
people may leave their church alone. 

— You hear ? said Dante turning to Mrs Dedalus. 

— Mr Casey ! Simon ! said Mrs Dedalus, let it end now. 

[31] 



— Too bad ! Too bad ! said Uncle Charles. 

— What? cried Mr Dedalus. Were we to desert him 
at the bidding of the English people ? 

— He was no longer worthy to lead, said Dante. He 
was a public sinner. 

— We are all sinners and black sinners, said Mr Casey 
coldly. 

— Woe be to the man by whom the scandal cometh! 
said Mrs Riordan. It would he better for him that a 
millstone were tied about his neck and that he were cast 
into the depths of the sea rather than that he should 
scandalise one of these, my least little ones. That is the 
language of the Holy Ghost. 

— And very bad language if you ask me, said Mr 
Dedalus coolly. 

— Simon ! Simon ! said Uncle Charles. The boy. 

— Yes, yes, said Mr Dedalus. I meant about the 
. . . I was thinking about the bad language of that 
railway porter. Well now, that's all righf. Here, 
Stephen, show me your plate, old chap. Eat away now. 
Here. 

He heaped up the food on Stephen's plate and served 
Uncle Charles and Mr Casey to large pieces of turkey 
and splashes of sauce. Mrs Dedalus was eating little and 
Dante sat with her hands in her lap. She was red in the 
face. Mr Dedalus rooted with the carvers at the end of 
the dish and said : 

— There's a tasty bit here we call the pope's nose. If 
any lady or gentleman . . . 

He held a piece of fowl up on the prong of the carv- 
ingfork. Nobody spoke. He put it on his own plate, 
saying: 

— Well, you can 't say but you were asked. I think I 

[32] 



had better eat it myself because I'm not well in my 
health lately. 

He winked at Stephen and, replacing the dish-cover, 
began to eat again. 

There was a silence while he ate. Then he said : 

— Well now, the day kept up fine after all. There 
were plenty of strangers down too. 

Nobody spoke. He said again : 

— I think there were more strangers down than last 
Christmas. 

He looked round at the others whose faces were bent 
towards their plates and, receiving no reply, waited for 
a moment and said bitterly: 

— Well, my Christmas dinner has been spoiled any- 
how. 

— There could be neither luck nor grace, Dante said, 
in a house where there is no respect for the pastors of 
the church. 

Mr Dedalus threw his knife and fork noisily on his 
plate. 

— Respect ! he said. Is it for Billy with the lip or for 
the tub of guts up in Armagh ? Respect ! 

— Princes of the church, said Mr Casey with slow 
scorn. 

— Lord Leitrim's coachman, yes, said Mr Dedalus. 

— They are the Lord's anointed, Dante said. They 
are an honour to their country. 

— Tub of guts, said Mr Dedalus coarsely. He has a 
handsome face, mind you, in repose. You should see 
that fellow lapping up his bacon and cabbage of a cold 
winter's day. Johnny! 

He twisted his features into a grimace of heavy bes- 
tiality and made a lapping noise with his lips. 

[33] 



— Really, Simon, you should not speak that way be- 
fore Stephen. It's not right. 

— 0, he 11 remember all this when he grows up, said 
Dante hotly — the language he heard against God and 
religion and priests in his own home. 

— Let him remember too, cried Mr Casey to her from 
across the table, the language with which the priests and 
the priests' pawns broke Parnell's heart and hounded 
him into his grave. Let him remember that too when he 
grows up. 

— Sons of bitches ! cried Mr Dedalus. When he was 
down they turned on him to betray him and rend him 
like rats in a sewer. Lowlived dogs ! And they look it ! 
By Christ, they look it! 

— They behaved rightly, cried Dante. They obeyed 
their bishops and their priests. Honour to them ! 

— Well, it is perfectly dreadful to say that not even 
for one day in the year, said Mrs Dedalus, can we be 
free from these dreadful disputes ! 

Uncle Charles raised his hands mildly and said : 

— Come now, come now, come now ! Can we not have 
our opinions whatever they are without this bad temper 
and this bad language? It is too bad surely. 

Mrs Dedalus spoke to Dante in a low voice but Dante 
said loudly: 

— I will not say nothing. I will defend my church 
and my religion when it is insulted and spit on by rene- 
gade catholics. 

Mr Casey pushed his plate rudely into the middle of 
the table and, resting his elbows before him, said in a 
hoarse voice to his host : 

— Tell me, did I tell you that story about a very fa- 
mous spit? 

[34] 



— You did not, John, said Mr Dedalus. 

— Why then, said Mr Casey, it is a most instructive 
story. It happened not long ago in the county Wicklow 
where we are now. 

He broke off and, turning towards Dante, said with 
quiet indignation : 

— And I may tell you, ma'am, that I, if you mean me, 
am no renegade catholic. I am a catholic as my father 
was and his father before him and his father before him 
again when we gave up our lives rather than sell our 
faith. 

— The more shame to you now, Dante said, to speak 
as you do. 

— The story, John, said Mr Dedalus smiling. Let us 
have the story anyhow. 

— Catholic indeed! repeated Dante ironically. The 
blackest protestant in the land would not speak the lan- 
guage I have heard this evening. 

Mr Dedalus began to sway his head to and fro, croon- 
ing like a country singer. 

— I am no protestant, I tell you again, said Mr Casey 
flushing. 

'Mr Dedalus, still crooning and swaying his head, began 
to sing in a grunting nasal tone : 

0, come all you Roman catholics 
That never went to mass.
