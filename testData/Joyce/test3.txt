— I let her bawl away, said ^Mr. Casey. It was a cold 
day and to keep up my heart I had (saving your pres- 
ence, ma'am) a quid of Tullamore in my mouth and sure 
I couldn't say a word in any case because my mouth 
was full of tobacco juice. 

— Well, John? 

— Well. I let her bawl away, to her heart's content, 
Kitty O'Shea and the rest of it till at last she called that 
lady a name that I won't sully this Christmas board nor 
your ears, ma'am, nor my own lips by repeating. 

He paused. Mr Dedalus, lifting his head from the 
bone, asked: 

— And what did you do, John ? 

— Do ! said Mr Casey. She stuck her ugly old face up 
at me when she said it and I had my mouth full of to- 
bacco juice. I bent down to her and Phth! says I to 
her like that. 

He turned aside and made the act of spitting. 

— Phth ! says I to her like that, right into her eye. 
He clapped a hand to his eye and gave a hoarse scream 

of pain. 

[37] 



— Jesus, Mary and Joseph! says she. I'm blinded! 
I'm blinded and drownded! 

He stopped in a fit of coughing and laughter, re- 
peating : 

— I'm blinded entirely. 

Mr Dedalus laughed loudly and lay back in his chair 
while Uncle Charles swayed his head to and fro. 

Dante looked terribly angry and repeated while they 
laughed : 

— Very nice ! Ha ! Very nice ! 

It was not nice about the spit in the woman's eye. 

But what was the name the woman had called Kitty 
O'Shea that Mr Casey would not repeat? He thought 
of Mr Casey walking through the crowds of people and 
making speeches from a wagonette. That was what he 
had been in prison for and he remembered that one 
night Sergeant O'Neill had come to the house and had 
stood in the hall, talking in a low voice with his father 
and chewing nervously at the chinstrap of his cap. And 
that night Mr Casey had not gone to Dublin by train but 
a car had come to the door and he had heard his father 
say something about the Cabinteely road. 

He was for Ireland and Parnell and so was his father : 
and so was Dante too 'for one night at the band on the 
esplanade she had hit a gentleman on the head with her 
umbrella because he had taken off his hat when the band 
played God save the Queen at the end. 

Mr Dedalus gave a snort of contempt. 

— Ah, John, he said. It is true for them. We are an 
unfortunate priestridden race and always were and al- 
ways will be till the end of the chapter. 

Uncle Charles shook his head, saying : 

[38]. 



— A bad business ! A bad business ! 
Mr Dedalus repeated : 

— A priestridden Godforsaken race ! 

lie pointed to the portrait of his grandfather on the 
wall to his right. 

— Do you see that old chap up there, John? he said. 
He was a good Irishman when there was no money in the 
job. He was condemned to death as a whiteboy. But 
he had a saying about our clerical friends, that he would 
never let one of them put his two feet under his mahog- 
any. 

Dante broke in angrily: 

— If we are a priestridden race we ought to be proud 
of it! They are the apple of God's eye. Touch them 
not, says Christ, for they are the apple of My eye. 

— And can we not love our country then? asked Mr 
Casey. Are we not to follow the man that was born to 
lead us ? 

— A traitor to his country ! replied Dante. A traitor, 
an adulterer! The priests were right to abandon him. 
The priests were always the true friends of Ireland. 

— Were they, faith? said Mr Casey. 

He threw his fist on the table and, frowning angrily, 
protruded one finger after another. 

— Didn't the bishops of Ireland betray us in the time 
of the union when Bishop Lanigan presented an address 
of loyalty to the Marquess Cornwallis? Didn't the bish- 
ops and priests sell the aspirations of their country in 
1829 in return for catholic emancipation? Didn't they 
denounce the f enian movement from the pulpit and in the 
confession box? And didn't they dishonour the ashes of 
Terence Bellew MacManus ? 

[39] 



His face was glowing with anger and Stephen felt the 
glow rise to his own cheek as the spoken words thrilled 
him. Mr Dedalus uttered a guffaw of coarse scorn. 

— 0, by God — he cried — I forgot little old Paul 
Cullen ! Another apple of God 's eye ! 

Dante bent across the table and cried to Mr Casey : 

— Right ! Right ! They were always right ! God and 
morality and religion come first. 

Mrs Dedalus, seeing her excitement, said to her : 

— Mrs Riordan, don't excite yourself answering them. 

— God and religion before everything ! Dante cried. 
God and religion before the world ! 

Mr Casey raised his clenched fist and brought it down 
on the table with a crash. 

— Very well, then, he shouted hoarsely, if it comes to 
that, no God for Ireland ! 

— John ! John ! cried Mr Dedalus, seizing his guest by 
the coat sleeve. 

Dante stared across the table, her cheeks shaking. Mr 
Casey struggled up from his chair and l>ent across the 
table towards her, scraping the air from- before his eyes 
with one hand as though he were tearing aside a cobweb. 

— No God for Ireland! he cried. We have had too 
much God in Ireland. Away with God ! 

— Blasphemer! Devil! screamed Dante, starting to 
her feet and almost spitting in his face. 

Uncle Charles and Mr Dedalus pulled Mr Casey back 
into his chair again, talking to him from both sides rea- 
sonably. He stared before him out of his dark flaming 
eyes, repeating: 

— Away with God, I say ! 

Dante shoved her chair violently aside and left the 
table, upsetting her napkinring which rolled slowly along 

[40] 



the carpet and came to rest against the foot of an easy- 
chair. Mrs Dedalus rose quickly and followed her to- 
wards the door. At the door Dante turned round vio- 
lently and shouted down the room, her cheeks flushed 
and quivering with rage : 

— Devil out of hell! We won! We crushed him to 
death ! Fiend ! 

The door slammed behind her. 

Mr Casey, freeing his arms from his holders, suddenly 
bowed his head on his hands with a sob of pain. 

— Poor Parnell ! he cried loudly. My dead king ! 
He sobbed loudly and bitterly. 

Stephen, raising his terrorstricken face, saw that his 
father's eyes were full of tears. 



The fellows talked together in little groups. 
One fellow said : 

— They were caught near the Hill of Lyons. 

— Who caught them ? 

— Mr Gleeson and the minister. They were on a car. 
The same fellow added : 

— A fellow in the higher line told me. 
Fleming asked: 

— But why did they run away, tell us t 

— I know why, Cecil Thunder said. Because they had 
f ecked cash out of the rector 's room. 

— Who f ecked it? 

— Kickham's brother. And they all went shares in it. 
But that was stealing. How could they have done 

that? 

— A fat lot you know about it, Thunder ! Wells said. 
I know why they scut. 

[41] 



— Tell us why. 

— I was told not to, "Wells said. 

— 0, go on, Wells, all said. You might tell us. We 
won't let it out. 

Stephen bent forward his head to hear. Wells looked 
round to see if anyone was coming. Then he said se- 
cretly : 

— You know the altar wine they keep in the press in 
the sacristy? 

— Yes. 

— Well, they drank that and it was found out who did 
it by the smell. And that's why they ran away, if you 
want to know. 

And the fellow who had spoken first said : 

— Yes, that's what I heard too from the fellow in the 
higher line. 

The fellows were all silent. Stephen stood among 
them, afraid to speak, listening. A faint sickness of 
awe made him feel weak. How could they have done 
that? He thought of the dark silent sacristy. There 
were dark wooden presses there where the crimped sur- 
plices lay quietly folded. It was not the chapel but still 
you had to speak under your breath. It was a holy 
place. He remembered the summer evening he had been 
there to be dressed as boat-bearer, the evening of the 
procession to the little altar in the wood. A strange and 
holy place. The boy that held the censer had swung it 
gently to and fro near the door with the silvery cap 
lifted by the middle chain to keep the coals lighting. 
That was called charcoal: and it had burned quietly as 
the fellow had swung it gently and had given off a weak 
sour smell. And then when all were vested he had stood 
holding out the boat to the rector and the rector had 

[42] 



put a spoonful of incense in and it had hissed on the 
red coals. 

The fellows were talking together in little groups here 
and there on the playground. The fellows seemed to 
him to have grown smaller : that was because a sprinter 
had knocked him down the day before, a fellow out of 
second of grammar. He had been thrown by the fel- 
low's machine lightly on the cinderpath and his spec- 
tacles had been broken in three pieces and some of the 
grit of the cinders had gone into his mouth. 

That was why the fellows seemed to him smaller and 
farther away and the goalposts so thin and far and the 
soft grey sky so high up. But there was no play on 
the football grounds for cricket was coming: and some 
said that Barnes would be the prof and some said it 
would be Flowers. And all over the playgrounds they 
were playing rounders and bowling twisters and lobs. 
And from here and from there came the sounds of the 
cricket bats through the soft grey air. They said : pick, 
pack, pock, puck: little drops of water in a fountain 
slowly falling in the brimming bowl. 

Athy, who had been silent, said quietly : 

— You are all wrong. 

All turned towards him eagerly. 

— Why? 

— Do you know ? 

— Who told you? 

— Tell us, Athy. 

Athy pointed across the playground to where Simon 
Moonan was walking by himself kicking a stone before 
him. 

— Ask him, he said. 

The fellows looked there and then said : 
[43] 



— Why him? 

— Is he in it ? 

Athy lowered his voice and said: 

— Do you know why those fellows scut? I will tell 
you but you must not let on you know. 

— Tell us, Athy. Go on. You might if you know. 
He paused for a moment and then said mysteriously: 

— They were caught with Simon Moonan and Tusker 
Boyle in the square one night. 

The fellows looked at him and asked : 

— Caught? 

— What doing? 
Athy said: 

— Smugging. 

All the fellows were silent : and Athy said : 

— And that's why? 

Stephen looked at the faces of the fellows but they 
were all looking across the playground. He wanted to 
ask somebody about it. What did that mean about the 
smugging in the square? Why did the five fellows out 
of the higher line run away for that? It was a joke, he 
thought. Simon Moonan had nice clothes and one night 
he had shown him a ball of creamy sweets that the fel- 
lows of the football fifteen had rolled down to him along 
the carpet in the middle of the refectory when he was 
at the door. It was the night of the match against the 
Bective Rangers and the ball was made just like a red 
and green apple only it opened and it was full of the 
creamy sweets. And one day Boyle had said that an 
elephant had two tuskers instead of two tusks and that 
was why he was called Tusker Boyle but some fellows 
called him Lady Boyle because he was always at his 
nails, paring them. 

[44] 



Eileen had long thin cool white hands too because she 
was a girl. They were like ivory ; only soft. That was 
the meaning of Tower of Ivory but protestants could not 
understand it and made fun of it. One day he had stood 
beside her looking into the hotel grounds. A waiter was 
running up a trail of bunting on the flagstaff and a fox 
terrier was scampering to and fro on the sunny lawn. 
She had put her hand into his pocket where his hand was 
and he had felt how cool and thin and soft her hand was. 
She had said that pockets were funny things to have: 
and then all of a sudden she had broken away and had 
run laughing down the sloping curve of the path. Her 
fair hair had streamed out behind her like gold in the 
sun. Tower of Ivory, House of Gold. By thinking of 
things you could understand them. 

But why in the square? You went there when you 
wanted to do something. It was all thick slabs of slate 
and water trickled all day out of tiny pinholes and there 
was a queer smell of stale water there. And behind the 
door of one of the closets there was a drawing in red 
pencil of a bearded man in a Roman dress with a brick 
in each hand and underneath was the name of the 
drawing : 

Balbus was building a wall. 

Some fellows had drawn it there for a cod. It had a 
funny face but it was very like a man with a beard. And 
on the wall of another closet there was written in back- 
hand in beautiful writing: 

Julius Ccesar wrote The Calico Belly. 

Perhaps that was why they were there because it was 
a place where some fellows wrote things for cod. But 
all the same it was queer what Athy said and the way 
he said it. It was not a cod because they had run away. 

[45] 



He looked with the others across the playground and 
began to feel afraid. 
At last Fleming said : 

— And we are all to be punished for what other fel- 
lows did? 

— I won't come back, see if I do, Cecil Thunder said. 
Three days' silence in the refectory and sending us up 
for six and eight every minute. 

— Yes, said Wells. And old Barrett has a new way 
of twisting the note so that you can't open it and fold 
it again to see how many ferulae you are to get. I won't 
come back too. 

— Yes, said Cecil Thunder, and the prefect of studies 
was in second of grammar this morning. 

— Let us get up a rebellion, Fleming said. Will we ? 
All the fellows were silent. The air was very silent 

and you could hear the cricket bats but more slowly than 
before : pick, pock. 
Wells asked: 

— What is going to be done to them? 

— Simon Moonan and Tusker are going to be flogged, 
Athy said, and the fellows in the higher line got their 
choice of flogging or being expelled. 

— And which are they taking? asked the fellow who 
had spoken first. 

— All are taking expulsion except Corrigan, Athy an- 
swered. He 's going to be flogged by Mr Gleeson. 

— I know why, Cecil Thunder said. He is right and 
the other fellows are wrong because a flogging wears off 
after a bit but a fellow that has been expelled from col- 
lege is known all his life on account of it. Besides 
Gleeson won't flog him hard. 

— It's best of his play not to, Fleming said. 

[46] 



— I wouldn^t like to be Simon Moonan and Tusker, 
Cecil Thunder said. But I don't believe they will be 
flogged. Perhaps they will be sent up for twice nine. 

— No, no, said Athy. They'll both get it on the vital 
spot. 

Wells rubbed himself and said in a crying voice : 

— Please, sir, let me off ! 

Athy grinned and turned up the sleeves of his jacket, 
saying: 

It can 't he helped; 

It must he done. 

So down with your breeches 

And out with your hum. 

The fellows laughed ; but he felt that they were a little 
afraid. In the silence of the soft grey air he heard the 
cricket bats from here and from there : pock. That was 
a sound to hear but if you were hit then you would feel 
a pain. The pandybat made a sound too but not like 
that. The fellows said it was made of whalebone and 
leather with lead inside : and he wondered what was the 
pain like. There were different kinds of sounds. A 
long thin cane would have a high whistling sound and he 
wondered what was that pain like. It made him shivery 
to think of it and cold: and what Athy said too. But 
what was there to laugh at in it ? It made him shivery : 
but that was because you always felt like a shiver when 
you let down your trousers. It was the same in the 
bath when you undressed yourself. He wondered who 
had to let them down, the master or the boy himself. 
how could they laugh about it that way? 

He looked at Athy 's rolled-up sleeves and knuckly inky 
hands. lie had rolled up his sleeves to show how Mr 

147] 



Gleeson would roll up his sleeves. But Mr Gleeson had 
round shiny cuffs and clean white wrists and fattish 
white hands and the nails of them were long and pointed. 
Perhaps he pared them too like Lady Boyle. But they 
were terribly long and pointed nails. So long and cruel 
they were though the white fattish hands were not cruel 
but gentle. And though he trembled with cold and 
fright to think of the cruel long nails and of the high 
whistling sound of the cane and of the chill you felt at 
the end of your shirt when you undressed yourself yet 
he felt a feeling of queer quiet pleasure inside him to 
think of the white fattish hands, clean and strong and 
gentle. And he thought of what Cecil Thunder had 
said; that Mr Gleeson would not flog Corrigan hard. 
And Fleming had said he would not because it was best 
of his play not to. But that was not why. 
A voice from far out on the playground cried : 

— All in! 

And other voices cried : 

— All in! All in! 

During the writing lesson he sat with his arms folded, 
listening to the slow scraping of the pens. Mr Harford 
went to and fro making little signs in red pencil and 
sometimes sitting beside the boy to show him how to 
hold his pen. He had tried to spell out the headline for 
himself though he knew already what it was for it was 
the last of the book. Zeal without prudence is like a 
ship adrift. But the lines of the letters were like fine 
invisible threads and it was only by closing his right eye 
tight tight and staring out of the left eye that he could 
make out the full curves of the capital. 

But Mr Harford was very decent and never got into a 
wax. All the other masters got into dreadful waxes. 

[48] 



But why were they to suffer for what fellows in the 
higher line did? Wells had said that they had drunk 
some of the altar wine out of the press in the sacristy 
and that it had been found out who had done it by the 
smell. Perhaps they had stolen a monstrance to run 
away with it and sell it somewhere. That must have 
been a terrible sin, to go in there quietly at night, to 
open the dark press and steal the flashing gold thing 
into which God was put on the altar in the middle of 
flowers and candles at benediction while the incense went 
up in clouds at both sides as the fellow swung the censer 
and Dominic Kelly sang the first part by himself in the 
choir. But God was not in it of course when they stole 
it. But still it was a strange and a great sin even to 
touch it. lie thought of it with deep awe; a terrible 
and strange sin: it thrilled him to think of it in the 
silence when the pens scraped lightly. But to drink the 
altar wine out of the press and be found out by the smell 
was a sin too: but it was not terrible and strange. It 
only made you feel a little sickish on account of the 
smell of the wine. Because on the day when he had 
made his first holy communion in the chapel he had shut 
his eyes and opened his mouth and put out his tongue 
a little : and when the rector had stooped down to give 
him the holy communion he had smelt a faint winy smell 
off the rector's breath after the wine of the mass. The 
word was beautiful: wine. It made you think of dark 
purple because the grapes were dark purple that grew 
in Greece outside houses like white temples. But the 
faint smell off the rector's breath had made him feel a 
sick feeling on the morning of his first communion. The 
day of your first communion was the happiest day of 
your life. And once a lot of generals had asked Napo- 

[49] 



leon what was the happiest day of his life. They thought 
he would say the day he won some great battle or the 
day he was made an emperor. But he said : 

— Gentlemen, the happiest day of my life was the day 
on which I made my first holy communion. 

Father Arnall came in and the Latin lesson began and 
he remained still leaning on the desk with his arms 
folded. Father Arnall gave out the theme-books and 
he said that they were scandalous and that they were all 
to be written out again with the corrections at once. 
But the worst of all was Fleming's theme because the 
pages were stuck together by a blot : and Father Arnall 
held it up by a corner and said it was an insult to any 
master to send him up such a theme. Then he asked 
Jack Lawton to decline the noun mare and Jack Lawton 
stopped at the ablative singular and could not go on with 
the plural. 

— You should be ashamed of yourself, said Father 
Arnall sternly. You, the leader of the class ! 

Then he asked the next boy and the next and the next. 
Nobody knew. Father Arnall became very quiet, more 
and more quiet as each boy tried to answer it and could 
not. But his face was black looking and his eyes were 
staring though his voice was so quiet. Then he asked 
Fleming and Fleming said that that word had no plural. 
Father Arnall suddenly shut the book and shouted at 
him: 

— Kneel out there in the middle of the class. You 
are one of the idlest boys I ever met. Copy out your 
themes again the rest of you. 

Fleming moved heavily out of his place and knelt be- 
tween the two last benches. The other boys bent over 
their theme-books and began to write. A silence filled
