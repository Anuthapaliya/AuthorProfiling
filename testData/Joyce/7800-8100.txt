_April_ 26. Mother is putting my new secondhand clothes in order. She
prays now, she says, that I may learn in my own life and away from home
and friends what the heart is and what it feels. Amen. So be it.

of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated
conscience of my race.

_April_ 27. Old father, old artificer, stand me now and ever in good
stead.
